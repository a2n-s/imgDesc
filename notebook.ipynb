    "###  1.1.   A brief overview on image captioning\n",
    "  The topic of captioning images is both a technical challenge and a crucial field of research in machine learning. Being able to automatically caption images in a natural language fashion would be very beneficial to the branch of machine learning interested in computer vision. This would not require the intervention of humans to write descriptive sentences about images that one want to use in a supervised dataset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  It is also a challenge of great difficulty. For us humans, it is quite easy, almost trivial to look at an image and describe every part of it, in no time. For machine to do that automatically, it is quite the opposite. Some papers and algorithms have achieved some good results but mostly rely on hard-coded knowledge given by researchers and engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "  We want to go beyond hard-coded visual concepts and sentence templates and generate, from any unseen image,a variable-sized, natural language sentence description.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to do the following.  \n",
    "<img src=\"res/figure-1.png\" height=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm takes as input an image, free of any caption and bounding boxes.  \n",
    "The network should then be able, after learning inferences on data only, i.e. without relying on any hard-coded knowledge, to cut the image into meaningful regions, caption them and finally construct a general caption for the whole image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what we see in the [Figure 1](res/figure-1.png). The original image is the one of a table covered with multiple objects. Regions are to be seen all over the scene, with their respective captions. And finally, a special region, the whole image in purple, is also captioned.\n",

    "  Our core insight is that we can leverage these large\n",
    "image-sentence datasets by treating the sentences as weak\n",
    "labels, in which contiguous segments of words correspond to\n",
    "some particular, but unknown location in the image. Our approach\n",
    "is to infer these alignments and use them to learn a generative\n",
    "model of descriptions. Concretely, our contributions are twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We develop a deep neural network model that infers the latent\n",
    "  alignment between segments of sentences and the region of the\n",
    "  image that they describe. Our model associates the two modalities\n",
    "  through a common, multimodal embedding space and a structured\n",
    "  objective. We validate the effectiveness of this approach on\n",
    "  image-sentence retrieval experiments in which we surpass\n",
    "  the state-of-the-art.\n",
    "- We introduce a multimodal Recurrent Neural Network\n",
    "  architecture that takes an input image and generates\n",
    "  its description in text. Our experiments show that the\n",
    "  generated sentences significantly outperform retrieval-based\n",
    "  baselines, and produce sensible qualitative predictions. We\n",
    "  then train the model on the inferred correspondences and evaluate\n",
    "  its performance on a new dataset of region-level annotations."
